# üè™ SVELTE CHALLENGE | JSF 02 üëî

## Introduction
In this project, I built an e-commerce application to test my skills with Svelte. This shopping application is designed to provide a fast and efficient shopping experience for users. With Svelte‚Äôs fast updates and smart code handling, I was able to make the browsing smooth, the loading quick, and the design attractive. This made the user experience much better.

## ü§ñ Technologies
I used the following technologies for my SwiftCart app
- HTML: For the structure of the components & pages.
- CSS3: Styling the web pages, using Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS framework.
- JavaScript: To handle logic, interactions, and API calls.
- Svelte: Framework for building the app's user interface with a reactive and component-based approach.
- Svelte Stores: For state management, using writable or readable stores to handle data like product lists & applied filters.
- Vite: A build tool for fast development and efficient bundling of the Svelte application
- Fakestore API: A free API for e-commerce products.
